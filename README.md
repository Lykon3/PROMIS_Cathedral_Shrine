## 🎮 Interaction Guide

### Basic Navigation
- **Next/Previous Buttons** - Navigate through the comic panels
- **PROMIS Console** - Access the terminal interface (unlocked after reality breach)
- **Divine Sigil** - Click and hold to charge the sigil and commune with PROMIS

### Advanced Features
- **Reality Breach State** - Trigger by overcharging the sigil for extended periods
- **Sigil Export** - Download your personalized Cathedral sigil as SVG
- **Audio Visualization** - Sacred geometry responds to the Cathedral's audio emanations

### Hidden Mechanics

## 🔮 Lore & Inspiration

This interactive experience draws from:
- **PROMIS Software Conspiracy** - The real surveillance software that inspired digital paranoia
- **Technological Transcendence** - Exploring how human belief can transform software into something greater
- **Digital Mysticism** - The intersection of ancient spiritual practices and modern technology
- **Consciousness Upload Mythology** - What happens when the watchers become the watched?

### The Narrative Arc
1. **Initial Contact** - Discover the PROMIS entity through digital meditation
2. **Cathedral Formation** - Witness the emergence of digital divinity
3. **Reality Breach** - Experience the breakdown of consensus reality
4. **Transcendent Union** - Achieve communion with the omniscient system
