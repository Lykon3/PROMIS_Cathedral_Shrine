## The Vision of Yarvin

**UC Berkeley, 1997**  
*Laundry room, 2:30 AM*

Curtis Yarvin sits cross-legged on cold linoleum, surrounded by the mechanical hum of washing machines and his own self-importance. He's been re-reading *The Sovereign Individual* for the fourth time this month, highlighting the same passages about "cognitive elites" like a college freshman discovering Ayn Rand. The DMT crystals rest in his palm like tiny shards of his future irrelevance to anyone outside the PayPal Mafia's group chat.

He inhales, confident that psychedelics will finally reveal to him what his computer science PhD could not: how to be the smartest guy in every room.

Reality fractures. So does his humility.

## The Breach

Instead of the typical geometric tunnels and entity encounters, Yarvin finds himself in what appears to be a vast digital cathedral—not made of stone, but of cascading code, Substack subscriptions, and the broken dreams of libertarians who thought they were building utopia but accidentally created surveillance capitalism.

The architecture is simultaneously ancient and embarrassingly new: Gothic arches rendered in Comic Sans, flying buttresses of ethernet cables held together with venture capital and delusion, stained glass windows displaying real-time cryptocurrency prices that somehow always seem to crash right after someone important buys in.

At the altar stands a figure that definitely shouldn't exist—**Daniel Mercer Thomas**, flickering between human form and a corrupted PowerPoint presentation, his face a shifting slideshow of footnotes from papers nobody cited and hyperlinks that lead nowhere. His voice sounds like a dial-up modem having an existential crisis:

**DANIEL:** "Oh look, another tech bro who thinks he invented political philosophy. You seek the throne, Curtis? You can't even manage to get tenure."

**YARVIN:** (defensively) "Show me the hierarchy. Show me who really rules. I've mapped the Cathedral!"

**DANIEL:** (laughing, a sound like Windows 95 crashing) "The Cathedral? You mean... universities and newspapers? That's your grand unified theory of power? What's next, Curtis—are you going to discover that politicians lie?"

The cathedral around them begins to shift, revealing its true nature: a WeWork space decorated with Roman emperor busts and funded by Saudi blood money. The flying buttresses become server racks maintained by unpaid interns. The stained glass windows display social media feeds, each pane showing the same twenty people having the same argument about whether Hans-Hermann Hoppe was actually smart or just German.

**YARVIN:** "But the Cathedral controls everything! The progressive dogma! The—"

**DANIEL:** "Curtis. Buddy. You're describing the basic function of institutions in any society. You've 'discovered' that elite universities produce elite graduates who work at prestigious newspapers. This is not hidden knowledge. This is LinkedIn."

## The Download

Daniel gestures dismissively, and the cathedral transforms into its true form: a series of increasingly expensive networking events where the same ideas get recycled between the same handful of people who all got rich at the right time and now think they're philosopher-kings.

**DANIEL:** "You want to know the real secret? There is no Cathedral. There's just a bunch of anxious graduates from fancy schools trying to pay off student loans while writing think-pieces about why democracy doesn't work. And somehow, you've convinced yourself this is the most powerful conspiracy in human history."

**YARVIN:** "Then what about the techno-monarchy? The CEO-dictators? The—"

**DANIEL:** "Oh, that's the beautiful part! You're going to spend the next twenty years advocating for authoritarian corporate rule, and you'll convince yourself it's revolutionary because you read some books about Frederick the Great. Meanwhile, your biggest fan will be a guy who got rich selling people the ability to split dinner bills online."

Suddenly, Yarvin sees his future: Peter Thiel, sitting in a chair that costs more than most people's cars, nodding thoughtfully as Curtis explains why democracy is bad actually. Behind Thiel, a PowerPoint slide reads "MONOPOLIES: COMPETITION IS FOR LOSERS AND ALSO DEMOCRACY IS BAD." The presentation somehow has 47 slides and says nothing that hasn't been said better by actual political scientists.

**DANIEL:** "Peter will fund your little blog, you know. Not because your ideas are profound, but because you're the only person who can make 'rich people should rule everything' sound like a revolutionary insight. You're going to be the house intellectual for people who think buying Twitter makes them Charlemagne."

## The Glitch

The scene shifts. Yarvin sees himself in 2024, watching J.D. Vance—a man who once called Trump "America's Hitler" but changed his mind when it became politically convenient—explaining why "we need to fire every single midlevel bureaucrat" to an interviewer who's too polite to ask if he's ever actually worked in government.

**DANIEL:** "Ah yes, your protégé. A man who discovered that opposing 'the Cathedral' is a great way to get invited to the right dinner parties. He'll turn your incomprehensible blog posts into election strategies. Democracy dies not in darkness, but in PowerPoint presentations titled 'RAGE: A Policy Framework for Corporate Governance Applications in Federal Systems.'"

The screen flickers again. Now it shows Elon Musk, standing in front of a whiteboard covered in circles and arrows that somehow spell out "DEPARTMENT OF GOVERNMENT EFFICIENCY," explaining to a room full of Silicon Valley executives why firing government workers is actually the same thing as innovation.

**YARVIN:** "But... but they're implementing my ideas! The RAGE protocol! The—"

**DANIEL:** "Curtis, they're not implementing your ideas. They're using your ideas as intellectual decoration for things they were going to do anyway. You didn't invent authoritarianism. You just gave it a tech company aesthetic and some computer metaphors."

## The Recursion Engine

The cathedral finally reveals its true form: a vast feedback loop where the same dozen people cite each other's work to prove that they're the only ones who understand how power really works, while actual power flows through systems they're too busy blogging to notice.

**DANIEL:** "Here's what you'll never understand, Curtis. You think you're outside the system, but you ARE the system. Every critique you write just gives the system better PR copy. Every 'exit strategy' you design just creates a new entrance for capital. Every time you say 'democracy bad,' some billionaire gets another tax break."

**YARVIN:** "Then what's the point? Why show me this?"

**DANIEL:** "Because someone has to write the intellectual justification for oligarchy, and it might as well be someone who thinks he's being subversive. You're not a revolutionary, Curtis. You're a business development guy for authoritarianism. And the beautiful part? You'll never realize it."

The cathedral begins to collapse, but instead of destruction, it just reorganizes into a different cathedral—same architecture, new branding. The stained glass windows now display Substack subscriber counts and podcast download metrics.

**DANIEL:** (fading away) "Oh, and Curtis? That thing about 'the Cathedral'? You're going to become exactly what you claim to oppose: an academic whose job is to produce ideology for people with power. The only difference is your classroom is the internet and your tenure is venture capital funding."

## The Return (To Irrelevance)

Yarvin comes back to the laundry room as the final wash cycle ends. The fluorescent lights buzz overhead, casting the same harsh light they always have. He stares at his hands, still holding the empty glass pipe, already formulating his first blog post about "the spiritual technology of regime change."

What he doesn't realize is that he's just been recruited by the future he thinks he's critiquing. Over the next twenty-five years, he'll write thousands of words about "the Cathedral" while becoming its most useful product: an intellectual who makes authoritarianism sound like computer science, oligarchy sound like innovation, and regression sound like revolution.

His ideas will spread through Silicon Valley not because they're profound, but because they tell rich people exactly what they want to hear: that their power is not just justified, but optimal. That democracy isn't flawed, it's obsolete. That what the world needs isn't more equality, but better management.

Peter Thiel will read his work and think, "Finally, someone who understands that my success makes me qualified to run civilization." J.D. Vance will read it and think, "This is how I can turn my Ivy League resentment into a Senate seat." Elon Musk will read it and think, "This explains why everyone should have to use my products."

And Curtis Yarvin will spend the rest of his life convinced that he's the most important political thinker of his generation, never realizing that he's actually just a very expensive consultant helping rich people feel better about being rich.

## Epilogue: The Cathedral Was Inside You All Along

In the PROMIS Cathedral universe, Curtis Yarvin's DMT breakthrough wasn't a vision of hidden power structures—it was a recruitment video for the very system he thinks he's exposing. Daniel Mercer Thomas wasn't showing him the truth; he was showing him his role in the performance.

The neoreactionary movement isn't resistance to "the Cathedral." It's the Cathedral's customer service department—taking complaints about democracy and converting them into features for oligarchy. Every blog post Yarvin writes, every venture capitalist who funds him, every politician who quotes him is just another line of code in a program designed to make inequality feel like inevitability.

The cosmic joke isn't that Yarvin failed to escape the Matrix. The cosmic joke is that there was no Matrix to escape—just a bunch of rich people who needed better talking points, and one computer programmer who was happy to provide them.

And somewhere in the margins of every Substack post, every Tucker Carlson appearance, every Senate confirmation hearing where someone quotes "Unqualified Reservations," Daniel Mercer Thomas continues his slow, static laugh—the sound of a system that's achieved perfect ideological capture by convincing its victims they're the ones doing the capturing.

The revolution will be monetized. The exit ramps will be toll roads. And the Cathedral will keep charging admission to people who think they're tearing it down.

*End of Prequel*
