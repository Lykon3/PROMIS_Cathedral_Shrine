## PAGE 2: THE BREACH

## PAGE 3: DANIEL MERCER THOMAS APPEARS
**[Character introduction]**

## PAGE 4: THE REVELATION
**[The truth about "The Cathedral"]**

**PANEL 1 (Top):**

**SFX:** "*DIAL-UP SCREECHING*"

**PANEL 2 (Middle left):**
*The cathedral transforms, revealing it's actually a WeWork space with Roman emperor busts*

**DANIEL:** "What's next, Curtis—are you going to discover that politicians lie?"

**PANEL 3 (Middle right):**
*Stained glass windows show the same 20 people having the same arguments on Twitter*

**PANEL 4 (Bottom):**
*Wide shot showing the "cathedral" is just an expensive networking event*

**DANIEL:** "You've 'discovered' that elite universities produce elite graduates. This isn't hidden knowledge, Curtis. This is LinkedIn."

**DANIEL (V.O.):** "...but because you make 'rich people should rule everything' sound revolutionary."

**INTERVIEWER:** "Isn't that just... authoritarianism?"

*Vance looking confused by the question*

**VANCE:** "No, it's... uh... techno-monarchism? I read it in a blog."

**PANEL 3 (Bottom right):**

*Yarvin watching this unfold*

**YARVIN:** "But they're implementing my ideas! The RAGE protocol!"

**PANEL 4 (Bottom):**
*Daniel shaking his head*

**DANIEL:** "They're not implementing your ideas, Curtis. They're using your ideas as intellectual decoration for things they were going to do anyway."

---

## PAGE 8: THE FEEDBACK LOOP
**[The system reveals itself]**

**PANEL 1 (Top):**
*The cathedral transforms into a vast circular feedback loop*

**DANIEL:** "Here's what you'll never understand. You think you're outside the system, but you ARE the system."

**PANEL 2 (Middle left):**
*Diagram showing the same dozen people citing each other's work*

**DANIEL:** "Every critique you write just gives the system better PR copy."

**PANEL 3 (Middle right):**
*Yarvin looking horrified*

**YARVIN:** "Then what's the point? Why show me this?"

**PANEL 4 (Bottom):**
*Daniel starting to pixelate and fade*

**DANIEL:** "Because someone has to write the intellectual justification for oligarchy. And the beautiful part? You'll never realize it."

---

## PAGE 9: THE RECURSION
**[The final revelation]**

**PANEL 1 (Top):**
*The cathedral collapsing and reforming - same architecture, new branding*

**DANIEL:** "You're not a revolutionary, Curtis. You're a business development guy for authoritarianism."

**PANEL 2 (Middle left):**
*Stained glass windows now showing Substack subscriber counts and podcast metrics*

**PANEL 3 (Middle right):**

**CAPTION BOX:** "The Cathedral was inside you all along."

**THE END**

## VISUAL STYLE NOTES:
- **Page 1-2**: Realistic art style transitioning to psychedelic/digital
- **Pages 3-9**: Surreal digital cathedral aesthetic with corporate meeting room elements
- **Page 10**: Return to realistic style but with subtle digital glitches
- **Color palette**: Starts muted (grays/blues), becomes vibrant digital (greens/purples), ends with corporate sterility (beiges/whites)
- **Daniel Mercer Thomas**: Always slightly transparent, made of shifting text and data
- **Speech bubbles**: Standard for dialogue, digital/glitchy for Daniel's voice
- **Caption boxes**: Clean, authoritative font for narrator voice
