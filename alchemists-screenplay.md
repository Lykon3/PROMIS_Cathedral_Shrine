   * Molecular structures as recurring visual motifs in backgrounds and panel transitions

2. **Panel Transitions:**
   * Use molecular structures as transitional devices between scenes
   * Employ frequent "aspect-to-aspect" transitions when depicting chemical reactions
   * Fractal zoom effects for mind-altering sequences

3. **Typography:**
   * Dialogue: Clean, modern sans-serif
   * Captions: Typewriter font for historical authenticity
   * Visionary/ethereal speech: Gradient-filled letterforms with trailing effects
   * Scientific notations: Precise technical fonts

4. **Historical Accuracy:**
   * Accurate depictions of Lemaire's underground lab (converted mining excavation)
   * Authentic molecular structures for MDMA, 2C-D, and other compounds
   * Period-correct laboratory equipment

5. **Symbolic Elements:**
   * Recurring lizard motifs hidden throughout backgrounds
   * Petroglyphs that transform into chemical formulas
   * Desert landscape that mirrors neural networks
   * Obsidian Sphere as metaphor for collective consciousness
